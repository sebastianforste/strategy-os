# Google Stitch Rules

When working with Google Stitch (or any tool/AI that generates UI or code under that name), you MUST provide the following instruction as part of your prompt or command:

> "Use the same bottom navigation, same header structure, same spacing, same typography across all screens."

This ensures visual consistency and structural coherence across the StrategyOS application.
