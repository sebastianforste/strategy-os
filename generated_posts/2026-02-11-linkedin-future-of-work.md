The office isn't dead.


Your utility is.


Everyone knows this. No one says it.


You spent three years arguing about Zoom calls.


Meanwhile, your role was being reduced to math.


I saw a $4,127,832 strategy deck last week.


It was 80 slides of "culture building" and "synergy."


Total theater.


The dangerous part is thinking your "process" saves you.


Process is for machines. Judgment is for humans.


Let me save you $200k and 18 months:


1. Stop selling hours. Start selling outcomes.


2. Kill the middleman in your own head.


3. Own the equity, not the cubicle.


I was staring at a parking fine from fair parken GmbH this morning while drinking a burnt espresso.


Even the local bureaucracy is more automated than your current workflow.


That should scare you.


What happens when your boss realizes an API doesn't need a performance review?

## Video Script
[Visual: Marcus Vane standing in a dimly lit, high-end office. No desk. Just him and a window.]

HOOK: Stop selling your hours. You're losing a game that's already over.

[Cut to: A 1-second clip of a massive strategy deck being tossed into a bin.]

MEAT: By 2028, if your job can be described in a manual, it’s gone. I saw a firm spend $4M on a digital transformation that was just a logo change. They're bankrupt now. Why? Because they bought theater, not outcomes. 

[Cut to: Marcus walking.]

The dangerous part is that you think you're safe because you're 'busy.' Busy is a bug, not a feature. In the next three years, judgment becomes the only currency. 

Here’s the move: Kill the task. Own the result. Build the equity.

[Visual: A parking fine from the fair parken GmbH document flashes on screen for 0.5s.]

Even the parking lots are smarter than your middle manager. Wake up.
