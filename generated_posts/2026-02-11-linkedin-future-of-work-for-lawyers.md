Your AI strategy is making your law firm more dangerous.


You think GenAI is about drafting faster.


It isn't.


Drafting was never your real bottleneck.


The real crisis is context compression.


When the "why" behind a legal clause vanishes, your risk profile explodes.


You are ignoring this because the billable hour rewards friction.


Stop focusing on the 50-page PDF and start building strategy-as-memory.


Rank your intent by prioritizing goals before the first draft starts.


Set your constraints by listing every line you will never cross.


Build negative knowledge by recording exactly why you rejected specific terms.


Without these, you are just an expensive copy-paster with a faster engine.


A perfect contract is worthless when it serves a strategy you’ve already abandoned.

## Video Script
Most law firms are drafting their own obsolescence. [Cut to Marcus Vane staring at camera] You think GenAI is about speed. It's not. It's about intent. [Visual: Text overlay 'Context Compression'] When your agent drafts a contract, does it know why you're signing it? Or is it just guessing based on 10,000 other PDFs? [Visual: Number counting up to $4.1M] This is the $4 million mistake. Stop focusing on the artifact. Start focusing on the strategy. Use StratMD. Capture the 'Why'. [Visual: Geometric line art of a filter] If you don't define your constraints, your AI will hallucinate your strategy. [Cut back to Marcus] Stop buying tools that write. Start building systems that remember. Click the link to fix your 2028 roadmap.
