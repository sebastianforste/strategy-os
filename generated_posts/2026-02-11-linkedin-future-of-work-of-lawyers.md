Your law firm is a museum piece.


Most partners just don't know it yet.


You sell hours while the world buys outcomes.


The billable hour is a suicide pact between you and your clients.


The dangerous part is thinking your "prestige" or "network" will save you.


It won't.


Let me save you $200k and 18 months of failing to adapt.


This is the 2028 reality:


1. Pricing: If you charge by the hour, you are incentivized to be slow. Software is fast.


2. Product: Stop writing 40-page memos. Build a logic tree that prevents the problem.


3. Profit: Margin comes from code and proprietary data, not burning out 24-year-olds.


I was looking at a $4,127,832 invoice from a Magic Circle firm last week for "due diligence."


An LLM could have done it for $12.


What happens when your clients realize they are paying for your mahogany desks and not your actual brain?

[0-5s] Marcus sits in a dark office, only a desk lamp on. He looks at the camera. "Your law firm isn't a business. It's a museum. And the lights are about to go out."

[5-20s] [Cut to: Close up] "You are still charging $800 an hour to draft documents that a 12-year-old with an API key can generate for three cents. That isn't 'prestige.' It's a scam. And your clients have finally caught on."

[20-45s] [Visual: Text overlay of 1. SYSTEMS, 2. OUTCOMES, 3. EQUITY] "The future of law isn't about being the smartest person in the room. It's about building the smartest system in the cloud. If you can't productize your expertise, you don't have a future. You have a job that's waiting to be deleted."

[45-60s] [Marcus leans in] "Stop selling your life by the hour. Start selling the solution. What happens to your lifestyle when the billable hour finally dies? Dig in now, or get buried later. Link in bio."
