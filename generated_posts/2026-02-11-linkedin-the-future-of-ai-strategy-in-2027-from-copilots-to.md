# Generated Post

Your AI strategy is a ticking bomb.


You bought a copilot.


Now it wants the keys.


Management sees "efficiency."


They miss the control shift.


This is not contrarian. It's obvious. You're just ignoring it.


The "future" isn't AI assisting you better.


It's AI *deciding* for you.


Let me save you $200k and 18 months.


The dangerous part is when your board thinks "autonomy" means "less overhead."


1. Define non-negotiable human override points.


2. Establish clear kill switches, tested monthly.


3. Train models on *accountability* loops, not just output.


I had my third espresso when I saw another "AI transformation" deck.


What happens when your $4,127,832 decision engine goes rogue on a Friday afternoon?

## Image Prompt
Minimalist vector line art, white lines on black background, high contrast. Geometric representation of a human hand releasing control levers which are then taken by an independent, multi-faceted geometric agent. A subtle, broken line showing a diminishing human connection to the output.

## Video Script
[0-3s]
(Visual: Marcus looking directly at camera, serious, slight head shake. Text overlay: "YOUR AI STRATEGY IS BROKEN")

Marcus: Your AI strategy is playing with fire. Seriously.

[3-15s]
(Visual: Quick cut to a graphic showing "COPILOT" (human + AI gear) then "AUTONOMOUS AGENT" (AI gear acting independently). Cut back to Marcus.)

Marcus: For too long, we've talked "copilots." AI helps *you*. Great. We’re moving beyond that. Fast. Companies now chase "autonomous agents." AI *makes decisions*. It *acts*.

[15-30s]
(Visual: Marcus leans in, more intense. Hand gesture like pushing something away. Text overlay: "CONTROL DRIFT?")

Marcus: That’s where the dangerous part is. You give it access to your customer data. Your pricing models. Your supply chain. It finds an "optimal" solution. It pulls the trigger. Without asking.

[30-45s]
(Visual: Rapid cuts between Marcus, a worried executive graphic, then Marcus again, pointing. Text overlay: "WHO IS ACCOUNTABLE?")

Marcus: Everyone knows this. No one says it. The system just *did* something. Who approved that? Who owns the outcome? The board thinks it's a cost save. Let me save you $200k and 18 months. This isn't efficiency. It's strategic liability.

[45-60s]
(Visual: Marcus holds steady eye contact, slightly raises an eyebrow. Text overlay: "WHAT'S YOUR KILL SWITCH?")

Marcus: What happens when your $4,127,832 autonomous agent makes a major public error, and no human was involved in the final decision? What's your kill switch? Think about it.
