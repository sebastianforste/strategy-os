# StrategyOS: The World-Class AI Strategist User Manual 🧬

Welcome to **StrategyOS**. This isn't just a "writing tool." It is an **Agentic Content Engine** designed to ghostwrite high-status, authoritative content that dominates the LinkedIn algorithm and establishes you as a Category King.

## 🏗️ 1. The Core Philosophy: "Anti-Robot"

Before generating a single word, understand the **StrategyOS Protocol**:

1.  **Status Over Volume**: We do not spam. We drop "Knowledge Bombs"—high-signal insights that force the reader to stop scrolling.
2.  **The Anti-Robot Filter**: The engine is hardcoded to reject "GPT-isms."
    *   🚫 *Banned*: "Delve," "Unleash," "Leverage," "In today's fast-paced world," "Excited to share."
    *   ✅ *Enforced*: "The dangerous part is...", "Here's the truth.", "Stop doing X."
3.  **Viral Syntax ("Bro-etry")**:
    *   Short, punchy sentences.
    *   Double spacing for readability.
    *   No paragraphs longer than 3 lines.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Treat StrategyOS as a Partner, not a Tool.** Don't ask it to "write a post." Ask it to "analyze this trend and give me a contrarian perspective."

## 🎛️ 3. Mission Control: The Streaming Console

This is your cockpit. Every strategic move starts here.

### The Input Field
Don't just paste a topic. Give the engine **Context**.
*   *Bad*: "Write about AI marketing."
*   *Good*: "Newsjack the recent OpenAI update. Take the stance that 'Prompt Engineering is dead.' Use a cynical tone."

### The "Big Four" Modes
Toggle these switches to change the engine's brain:

| Mode | Icon | Functionality | When to Use |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Newsjack** | ⚡ | **Real-Time Search**: Scans the web for the latest news on your topic. | When commenting on a breaking event (e.g., Apple Vision Pro launch). |
| **RAG** | 📚 | **Knowledge Base**: Searches your uploaded documents/memory for facts. | When writing about specific client results, case studies, or proprietary methods. |
| **Swarm** | 🐝 | **Agent Debate**: Invokes a "Council" of agents (Visionary, Skeptic) to argue before writing. | For complex, controversial topics where you need to bulletproof your logic. |
| **Agentic** | 📞 | **The Red Phone**: Fully autonomous loop. Researches, drafts, critiques, and refines until score > 80. | When you want the highest possible quality and have 2 minutes to wait. |

## 🛠️ 6. Advanced Agentic Tools

### 👻 Ghost Agent V2
*   **Purpose**: Autonomous background hunter.
*   **Action**: It wakes up periodically, scans your defined **Sectors** (e.g., SaaS, Fintech), and drafts content *without* you asking.

## 💡 8. Strategic Recommendations

### For LinkedIn
*   **The "Inversion"**: Take a commonly held belief in your industry and respectfully destroy it. (e.g., "Why 'Hustle Culture' is keeping you poor.")
*   **The "Visual Hook"**: Always attach a carousel or a high-contrast image. Text-only posts get buried.
*   **Comment Strategy**: Use **The Provocateur** to generate replies to big creators in your niche.

### For X (Twitter)
*   **Thread Openers**: Must be under 20 words. Use a statistic or a dollar sign.
*   **Frequency**: Use the **Ghost Agent** to schedule 3-5 tweets per day automatically.

## ❓ 9. Troubleshooting

*   **"System Stuck on 'Thinking'":**
    *   *Fix*: Check if you have other terminal windows open using the same port. Run `lsof -i :3000` to check.
*   **"Content sounds too generic":**
    *   *Fix*: You haven't trained the Voice Studio. Upload more examples of *your* writing.
    *   *Fix*: Turn **RAG** on to force it to use your specific knowledge.
*   **"Unable to acquire lock":**
    *   *Fix*: Run the `start_strategyos.command` script to clear the locks and restart.
